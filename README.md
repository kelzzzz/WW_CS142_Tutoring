This is a repository for Wilbur Wright's CS142 Mon/Wed group tutoring section. Students can make pull requests into this repository for code feedback and learning about managed repositories.

## How do I get feedback on my code?
You need to get your code into this repository and make a pull request.

There are two ways to do this:\
0) Check that you have a branch in the upstream repo. You should see your name under branches in the upper left. If you don't have a branch, talk to me before doing anything else!\

1) Fork the repository by clicking 'fork' in the upper right, and agreeing to clone it to your own github account.

2) In the files on your computer, create a folder named after your name. Inside the folder, make another for the assignment. Inside that folder, put your src file with all the code, and the .sln files for the project. If you have a complicated project structure, please talk to me on how to merge it.

4) In the forked tutoring repo, go to the branch with your name. Click on upload your files, and drag the folder with your name into it. If it is not your first time uploading, you can simply add your newest project file to the existing name folder. Make sure you merge into the branch with your name on it.

6) [Open a pull request using these instructions.](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) It will ask where to merge to; make sure you merge to the branch with your name, or it will be denied.

7) You will get feedback on your pull request. Optionally, once you get your code working, you can fix the issue and get the PR merged so folks can see merges on your github account (and be proud!).
